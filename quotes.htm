<p>&quot;They're trying to kill me,&quot; Yossarian told him calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;No one's trying to kill you,&quot; Clevinger cried.</p>
<p>&quot;Then why are they shooting at me?&quot; Yossarian asked.</p>
<p>&quot;They're shooting at everyone,&quot; Clevinger answered. &quot;They're trying to kill everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what difference does that make?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anything worth living for,&quot; said Nately, &quot;is worth dying for.&quot;

<p>&quot;And anything worth dying for,&quot; answered the sacrilegious old man, &quot;is certainly worth living for.&quot;

<p>&quot;Why are they going to disappear him?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I don't know.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't make sense. It isn't even good grammar. What the hell does it mean when they disappear somebody?&quot;</p>

<p>Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three. Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as a man lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were always impressed by how unimpressive he was.</p>

<p>&quot;What is a country? A country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries, usually unnatural. Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia. There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war. Surely so many countries can't all be worth dying for.&quot; </p>
