			<p>So Quora has this programming <a href="https://www.quora.com/challenges#python_uri" target="_blank">challenge</a> on creating a Python API for handling URI. I'm quoting a part of the challenge here:</p>

			<blockquote class="gray"><p>In Python, write a class or module with a bunch of functions for manipulating a URI. For this exercise, pretend that the urllib, urllib2, and urlparse modules don't exist. You can use other standard Python modules, such as re, for this. The focus of the class or module you write should be around usage on the web, so you'll want to have things that make it easier to update or append a querystring var, get the scheme for a URI, etc., and you may want to include ways to figure out the domain for a URL (british-site.co.uk, us-site.com, etc.)</p></blockquote>

			<p>Here are the main objectives for the API:</p>
			<ul>
				<p><li><u>Correctness</u>. Should match standards (as mentioned in RFCs) and correctly handle all edge cases.</li></p>
				<p><li><u>Should be elegant</u>. Common things should be easy to do.</li></p>
				<p><li>Code <u>must</u> conform with the PEP 8 style guide.</li></p>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Ideally I would want to sit down to design and code a solution in one stretch but I can't do that in the middle of a semester <img src="../smiley/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="#sad-face">. But that won't stop me! I'll be working on this problem for a few hours over the next week and hopefully I'll be done by Sunday <img src="../smiley/fb-thumbs-up-icon.png" alt=":thumbs-up:" title="thumbs up!" height="17" width="17">.

				Well. I couldn't get to this before today. To startoff, I need to go over the RFCs once. Just a cursory look. Because I really can't afford to go deep just yet. A quick search reveals that there are a multitude of RFCs on URIs and URLs. RFCs 1738, 2732, 2396, 1808 and 3986 to name a few. As it turns out <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a> obsoletes or updates all of them. So that is the one I'm going to be following.
